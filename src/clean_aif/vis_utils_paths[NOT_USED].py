    maze's tiles.

    Inputs:

    - file_path: the file path where the cumulative reward data was stored while running the experiment;
    - v_len (integer): vertical length of the environment;
    - h_len (integer): horizontal length of the environment.

    Outputs:

    - heatmap showing the frequency with which maze's tiles have been visited.

    Note 1: ax.imshow() is used to produce the heatmap. Because of the way plt.colormesh works, the data
    has to be reshaped, transposed and rotated 90 degrees.

    Detailed explanation/example:

    Consider for example the top-left tile in a 6-by-9 maze, that tile corresponds to
    state 0 and is the first value in the vector 'average_state_visits'. When you reshape that array,
    you get a matrix of shape (6,9) and the state 0 average is at location [0,0] in the matrix.
    In other words, the matrix is isomorphic to the pictorial representation of the maze.
    However, plt.colormesh takes the values in the first row of the matrix (which is the top row in the maze)
    and by default plots them using their matrix coordinates to access some graph coordinates in X and Y.
    These are arrays of shape (7,10) that by default in this example look like
    X = [[0, 1,..,7,8,9],..,[0, 1,..,7,8,9]] and Y = [[0,..0,],..[6,..6]];
    these graph coordinates are used to draw the corners of the bounding squares in the colormesh grid of
    the chart.
    So, the values of the top row in the maze end up at the bottom of the chart (if nothing is done).
    The optional array arguments X and Y can be manually set (if you don't want to reshape the data).
    For more info, see the matplotlib documentation.
